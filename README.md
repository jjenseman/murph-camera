# murph-camera

""" making a application that will use picamera on the raspberry pi to monitor my dog while I am gone. I know these already exist bu thought it would be more fun to make my own. most of the code is right from the picamera documentation. my main goal if to connect to the raspberry pi using vlc on my iphone and connecting to the socket on the raspberry pi.
